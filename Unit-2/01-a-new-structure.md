#A New Structure

As our Angular apps grow we'll need a new file structure.  It won't work to put everything in an `app.js` file when we have multiple controllers, modules, directives, filters, services, and more.  

We're going to start by using the following structure:

```
app
	css
	js
		app.js
		controllers.js
		directives.js
		filters.js
		services.js
	index.html
```

//about to start unit two and learn sql at the same time.

This structure is pretty simple.  We have an app.js file where we will declare our app and all dependencies.  For now it will just look like:

```js
var app = angular.module("whateverYourModuleNameIs")
```

We also have files like `controllers.js` and `directives.js` which contain all of our controllers or custom directives (we'll get there soon).  Basically, instead of writing everything inside of `app.js`, we've broken it out into separate files grouped by functionality.

In order for this structure to work, make sure you correctly include all the scripts in your `index.html` file.

**EXERICSE**

Convert the reddit clone app to this new file structure

**EXERCISE: Serve your reddit clone app using http-server.  Make sure everything works correctly.**

The next thing we'll want to do is serve up our application using some sort of server.  For now we can just run `http-server -c-1 -o` inside of the app directory.  Visit `localhost:8080` to see the application.

## Questions

* What are possible issues with this new file structure?
* When thinking about extending the single responsibility principle to the app structure, what are some other ways that the app could be structured?
* What are the differences between serving files from an http server and from the file system?  It seemed to work fine with just `open index.html` in the browser...
* Reflecting on the new structure and thinking back to lesson 1 - is Angular an MVC framework? How does the app structure support/disprove that?
