**Exercise** Follow along with the video and build the cryptocurrency convertor app. Make sure to implement the additional features detailed at the end of the videos

**Exercise** Read the first 2 sections of the [Angular Fire Development Guide](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/guide/).

####Questions

* What is AngularFire?
* Can you use Firebase with and an Angular app without AngularFire?
* What does it mean that AngularFire supports 3-way data binding?

**Be careful which AngularFire docs you use. We want verison 1.0 and greater.  1.0 is a signficant update that broke all the old tutorials and existing projects.**
